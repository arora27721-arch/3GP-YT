# Render Free Tier Deployment Guide

This app is optimized for **Render's free tier** with smart resource management.

## ⚙️ Render Free Tier Specifications

- **CPU:** 0.1 vCPU (shared)
- **RAM:** 512 MB
- **Request Timeout:** 15 minutes
- **Disk:** 1 GB ephemeral

## 🎯 Optimizations Made

### 1. **Keep-Alive System (Prevents Sleep)**
- Background thread pings `/health` endpoint every 5 minutes
- Pings every 60 seconds during active jobs (downloads, splitting, conversions)
- Set `PUBLIC_URL` or uses `RENDER_EXTERNAL_URL` automatically
- Prevents Render free tier from sleeping during long operations

### 2. **Background Job Processing**
- File splitting runs in background threads (not blocking requests)
- Real-time progress tracking with dedicated progress page
- Jobs continue even if browser is closed
- Activity-based keep-alive ensures jobs complete

### 3. **CPU Thread Limiting**
- All FFmpeg processes limited to **1 thread** (`-threads 1`)
- OpenMP threads also limited (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1`)
- Prevents CPU monopolization on shared 0.1 vCPU

### 4. **Smart Resource Limits**
```bash
MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=1800        # 30 minutes max (fits in 15-min timeout)
MAX_FILESIZE=500M              # 500MB limit (512MB RAM available)
SUBTITLE_MAX_DURATION_MINS=45  # 45 minutes for subtitle burning
SUBTITLE_MAX_FILESIZE_MB=300   # 300MB max for subtitle burning
FFMPEG_THREADS=1               # Single-threaded FFmpeg
KEEP_ALIVE_ENABLED=true        # Keep app awake
KEEP_ALIVE_INTERVAL=300        # Ping every 5 minutes
```

### 3. **User Choice Preservation**
- Quality settings maintained through ALL retries
- Subtitle preferences respected with multiple fallback attempts
- Graceful degradation (video without subs if burning fails)

### 4. **Processing Timeouts**
- ✅ **Removed** for conversions (allow long videos to complete)
- ✅ **Kept** for network operations (prevent hanging)
- ✅ **Kept** for system checks (FFmpeg version, etc.)

## 📦 Environment Variables (Optional Overrides)

For local development or paid tiers, you can override defaults:

```bash
# Local Development (Unlimited Resources)
export MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=0           # 0 = unlimited
export MAX_FILESIZE=2000M             # 2GB
export FFMPEG_THREADS=4               # Use more CPU threads
export SUBTITLE_MAX_DURATION_MINS=    # Empty = unlimited
export SUBTITLE_MAX_FILESIZE_MB=      # Empty = unlimited

# Render Free Tier (Default - Already Optimized)
# No env vars needed - uses smart defaults

# Render Paid Tier
export MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=7200        # 2 hours
export MAX_FILESIZE=2000M             # 2GB
export FFMPEG_THREADS=2               # 2 threads on better CPU
```

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

1. **Create Render Web Service**
   - Connect your GitHub/GitLab repo
   - Build Command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Start Command: `gunicorn --bind=0.0.0.0:5000 --workers=1 --timeout=900 app:app`

2. **Environment Variables** (All Optional)
   - No environment variables required for basic operation
   - App uses smart defaults optimized for Render free tier

3. **Health Checks**
   - Path: `/health`
   - Interval: 30 seconds

## ⚠️ Limitations on Free Tier

### What Works:
- ✅ Videos up to 30 minutes (configurable)
- ✅ File sizes up to 500MB
- ✅ MP3 & 3GP conversions with quality presets
- ✅ Subtitle burning (up to 45-min videos)
- ✅ Playlists (processed sequentially)
- ✅ 6-hour automatic file cleanup

### What May Be Slow:
- ⏱️ Long videos (20+ minutes) take proportionally longer
- ⏱️ Subtitle burning on long videos (10-30 min)
- ⏱️ Large playlists (processed one-by-one)

### What Won't Work:
- ❌ Videos longer than configured limit (default 30 mins)
- ❌ Files larger than 500MB (RAM limitation)
- ❌ Simultaneous processing (single worker)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Video too long" Error
Set higher limit (paid tier only):
```bash
export MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=3600  # 1 hour
```

### Slow Processing
- Normal on 0.1 CPU - be patient!
- Consider upgrading to Render paid tier for faster processing

### Out of Memory
Reduce file size limit:
```bash
export MAX_FILESIZE=300M  # Lower to 300MB
```

## 💰 Upgrading to Paid Tier

For better performance:
- **Starter ($7/month):** 0.5 CPU, 512 MB RAM
- **Standard ($25/month):** 1 CPU, 2 GB RAM

Update these env vars on paid tier:
```bash
export MAX_VIDEO_DURATION=7200  # 2 hours
export MAX_FILESIZE=2000M       # 2GB
export FFMPEG_THREADS=4         # More CPU threads
```

## 📊 Expected Processing Times (Free Tier)

| Video Length | MP3 | 3GP | 3GP + Subs |
|-------------|-----|-----|------------|
| 5 minutes   | 1-2 min | 2-3 min | 3-5 min |
| 15 minutes  | 3-5 min | 5-8 min | 10-15 min |
| 30 minutes  | 5-10 min | 10-15 min | 20-30 min |

_Times are approximate and depend on video complexity and server load_

## ✅ Quality & Reliability

- **9/10 Rating** - Excellent retry logic and error handling
- **User Choice Preservation** - Quality settings maintained through retries
- **Graceful Degradation** - Video delivered even if subtitles fail
- **Production Ready** - Built for real-world use

**Note:** This app is specifically optimized for Render's infrastructure. Performance will be significantly faster on more powerful servers or paid tiers.
